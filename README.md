# Cornucopia

## Project Brief

- **Build a web application using vite**. Must be your own work.
- **Use React framework** to build your application with _at least_
  - 3 components
  - 4 props
  - 2 state properties
  - 2 setState
  - 2 routes
- **Use 3rd party API and/or Firestore**
  - API call with Axios and display the data for the user. You may use any API of your choosing.
  - You may also opt to use Firebase/Firestore if you need to store data.
- **Craft a `README.md` file that explains your app** to the world.
- **Create wireframes** for your app and include it in your repo/readme.

## Description

Cornucopia is a recipe finder to assist in planning of meals.

### Technical Used

```
- React
- Tailwind CSS

```

### Wireframes

Created my initial wireframe on [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPAsqwMo=/?share_link_id=933854636951).

### User Stories

As a home cook, I want to find recipes, so that I can make use of ingredients in my fridge and explore different cultures through cuisine.

## Planning and Development Process

A basic story of your planning and developing this project.

1. Set Up project on Vite, Gitup Repo & deployed on Vercel
2. Indentified & tested the API
3. Created basic Wireframe
4. Mapped API content
5. Created a form to search API for recipes
6. Added Comps & Pages (Navbar, Recipe, Error)
7. Added Tailwind CSS
8. Added Favorites and buttons
9. Added Localstorage
10. Added checkbox for search (Intolerances & Cuisine)
11. Test and adjust for small media
12. Refactor and restructure comps & pages

### Problem-Solving Strategy

Started by deciding on the issue at hand, and how to utilise the API. By first creating the wireframe, could visualise the structure, components and pages I required.

Focused on identifying which features to add, and tried to break it down to smaller problems to solve. Mostly aimed to have a working code before tidying up.

Progressively improved the exisiting features or added more.

### Unsolved problems

- Update multiple selection using Semantic UI for better visual
